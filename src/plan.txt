1. Our program hosts 2 players and sends them a board with a given length and a time. They are then told to make words out of the given letters in the time limit and play until one user makes a mistake. The clients then play until they score 3 points. We will implement this with a fork() and by making sure the clients have 2 types of directions they can go based on what they receive from the server.

2. Figuring out when to send the correct data and making sure the data is parsed correctly on both server and client sides.

3. Man pages, stackoverflow, Tanzima
