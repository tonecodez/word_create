2. One thing that is not working in our code is shutting down both clients when
one gets shut down. It only works when the first player shuts down, and becomes
a bit buggy if the second player shuts down first. We believe that it is in our
implementation of the game that made this harder than it shouldve been. Since
only the primary player is sending anything to the server, we didn't know how to
check if the secondary player was still connected to the server. This proved to
be difficult. I believe that if we knew what we know now, we would have gone
about structuring our program a lot better where it could give us the ability to
expand a bit better. 

3. We tested our code by playing a game with multiple users, and by printing out
a lot of the information that was crucial to the gameplay to make sure that both
client and server were receiving the correct data at each interval of the game.
We also did different test cases, because most of the error came when we entered
an incorrect word. 

4. The most challenging part of this assignment was definitely ensuring that
both client and server were receiving the correct data when they needed to. It
was hard to sychronize the data and make sure that client and server were in the
correct places in the game logic.
